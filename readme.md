## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, brave)
- Internet connection (for Three.js CDN)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine

2. **Navigate** to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solar-system
   ```

3. **Serve the files** using one of these methods:

   **Option A: Using Python (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

   **Option B: Using Node.js**
   ```bash
   # Install a simple HTTP server
   npm install -g http-server
   
   # Start the server
   http-server
   ```

   **Option C: Using PHP**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

   **Option D: Using Live Server (VS Code)**
   - Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Alternative Setup (Direct File Opening)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Due to CORS policies, some browsers may not load Three.js properly when opening files directly. Using a local server is recommended.

If you want to try opening directly:
1. Double-click `index.html`
2. If it doesn't work, use one of the server methods above

## üéÆ How to Use

### Navigation Controls
- **Rotate View**: Left-click and drag
- **Pan**: Right-click and drag (or Ctrl+drag on Mac)
- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel or pinch on mobile
- **Reset Camera**: Click the "Reset" button

### Speed Controls
- Use the sliders in the control panel to adjust each planet's orbital speed
- Range: 0x (stopped) to 5x (5 times normal speed)
- Changes apply instantly without interrupting the animation

### Animation Controls
- **Pause/Resume**: Click the pause button to stop/start all planetary motion
- **Reset**: Restore all planets to default speeds and random positions

### Theme Toggle
- Click the moon/sun icon to switch between dark and light themes

### Planet Information
- Hover over any planet or the Sun to see detailed information
- Learn about surface temperatures, composition, and interesting facts

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Planets or Objects
Edit the `planetData` array in `script.js`:
```javascript
{
    name: 'Pluto',
    size: 0.1,
    distance: 60,
    speed: 0.004,
    color: 0x8C7853,
    info: 'Former ninth planet, now classified as a dwarf planet.'
}
```

### Modifying Colors and Themes
Update CSS custom properties in `style.css`:
```css
:root {
    --accent-color: #your-color;
    --panel-bg: rgba(your, values, here);
}
```

### Adjusting Performance
Modify these settings in `script.js`:
- `starVertices` count for star field density
- Geometry segments for planet detail level
- Shadow map resolution for quality vs performance

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Three.js Not Loading**
- Check internet connection
- Verify CDN links in `index.html`
- Try refreshing the page

**2. Blank Screen**
